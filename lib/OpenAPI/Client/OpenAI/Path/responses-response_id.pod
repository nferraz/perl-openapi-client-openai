=head2 C<GET /responses/{response_id}>

Get a model response


Retrieves a model response with the given ID.



=head3 Operation ID

C<getResponse>

    $client->getResponse( ... );

=head3 Parameters

=over 4

=item * C<response_id> (in path) (Required) - The ID of the response to retrieve.

Type: C<string>



=item * C<include> (in query) (Optional) - Additional fields to include in the response. See the `include`
parameter for Response creation above for more information.


Type: C<array>



=item * C<stream> (in query) (Optional) - If set to true, the model response data will be streamed to the client
as it is generated using [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#Event_stream_format).
See the [Streaming section below](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses-streaming)
for more information.


Type: C<boolean>



=item * C<starting_after> (in query) (Optional) - The sequence number of the event after which to start streaming.


Type: C<integer>



=item * C<include_obfuscation> (in query) (Optional) - When true, stream obfuscation will be enabled. Stream obfuscation adds
random characters to an `obfuscation` field on streaming delta events
to normalize payload sizes as a mitigation to certain side-channel
attacks. These obfuscation fields are included by default, but add a
small amount of overhead to the data stream. You can set
`include_obfuscation` to false to optimize for bandwidth if you trust
the network links between your application and the OpenAI API.


Type: C<boolean>
