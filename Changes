Revision history for OpenAPI-Client-OpenAI

0.24    2025-08-22

        - Model Updates: Added support for new `gpt-5` series models, including
        `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, and `gpt-5-nano`, across various API endpoints like
        Assistants and Chat Completions.
        - Conversations API Introduction: A new top-level `/conversations` endpoint has
        been added to create, retrieve, update, and delete conversations and their
        items. This provides a new way to manage and persist conversation state. The
        previous `/embeddings` endpoint has been removed to accommodate this new
        feature.
        - Images API Streaming: The Images API now supports streaming for both image
        generation (`/images/generations`) and editing (`/images/edits`). New
        parameters such as `input_fidelity` and `partial_images` have also been
        introduced for more control over image results.
        - Documentation and Code Examples: Replaced all Kotlin code examples with Java
        examples across the entire API specification. Endpoint summaries have been
        standardized for conciseness, with longer explanations moved into the
        `description` field. Additionally, internal documentation links have been
        updated to absolute URLs.
        - File API Enhancements: The organizational file storage limit has been
        increased to 1 TB. A new `expires_after` parameter allows setting an expiration
        policy upon file creation.
        - Responses API Updates: A new `conversation` parameter has been added to
        manage conversation state more effectively. The `user` parameter is now
        deprecated in favor of `safety_identifier` and `prompt_cache_key` for better
        user identification and caching. A `verbosity` parameter has also been added to
        control response conciseness.
        - Other API Updates: The Batch API now includes an `output_expires_after`
        parameter to manage the lifecycle of output files. Many schema definitions have
        been updated from `oneOf` to the more flexible `anyOf`.

          gpt-4o-mini-tts, and the audio transcription model is updated to
          gpt-4o-transcribe, with the addition of a streaming option for the
          transcription api.
        - Chat Completions Enhancements: Introduces new features for the Chat
          Completions API, including the ability to list, retrieve, update, and delete
          chat completions.  Support for metadata filtering is added, and the
          documentation clarifies parameter support across different models. 
        - Realtime API Expansion: Adds a new endpoint for creating realtime
          transcription sessions and incorporates C# examples for both audio generation
          and transcription.
        - Responses API Improvements:  Significant updates to the Responses
          API, with a focus on enhanced tool usage, including web search and file search,
          and the ability to stream responses. The API now also supports including image
          URLs in the input and provides detailed usage information.
        - Fine-tuning API Updates: Introduces new endpoints for managing
          fine-tuning checkpoints and their permissions, enabling organization owners to
          share and control access to fine-tuned models. Metadata is now supported for
          fine-tuning jobs. 
        - Other Updates:  Minor documentation improvements and clarifications
          across various API endpoints and parameters, including updates to model
          descriptions and available tools.
